var game = new Game();

//onclick of easy mode or hard mode button, then game.gameType = easy or hard depending on what was clicked
        //if gameType = easy, then use the easy choices
        //if gameType = hard, then use the hard choices
            //this is somewhat in the takeTurn() fcn
        //also the DOM will need to display the possible choices for the user depending on the game mode (which will update in the class on button click)
