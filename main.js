            //this is somewhat in the takeTurn() fcn
        //also the DOM will need to display the possible choices for the user depending on the game mode (which will update in the class on button click)

//connect data model to DOM
    //create variables
    //write show/hide functions

    //start with choosing game mode
        //variable to select the whole view so it can be hidden
            //this can also be the section that has the event listener? if event.target.id = easyMode then make the game mode easy, etc
        //add cursor: pointer to each individual div so they know they can click whereever they please
        //displayGameMode() --
            //if game mode is easy then show easy mode, hide choose mode view
    
    //then choosing a move
        //when emojis are clikced on the human Player's move is changed based on the click
        //the computer will also have to takeTurn()
        //set timeout will come in here
